 <h3 className="terms-paragraph-header">Your Details</h3>
 <p>When you register with the Book Store website, you will be required to choose a contact email address and password. You are responsible for all sessions and transactions taken under these details. You should keep your password safe and not disclose it to anyone. You should change it immediately if you feel it has been compromised.
 If any of your details change, such as your credit card billing address, you must inform Book Store as soon as possible. You may update your details by signing into your account on the Book Store website, and update the relevant section.</p>
  
 
 <h3 className="terms-paragraph-header">The Contract Between Us</h3>
 <p>Any contract for purchases made through the website will be with Book Store Booksellers Limited, whose registered office is situated at Book Store, 203-206 Piccadilly W1J 9HD, company registration number 610095 (Book Store).</p>
 <p>Book Store must receive payment of the whole of the price for the goods that you order before your order can be accepted, and the contract formed. Payment is not taken until the point of dispatch of the goods to you from our distribution centre. Once payment has been received Book Store will confirm that your order has been received by sending an email to you at the email address you provide in your registration form. The shipment email will include your name, the order number and the total price. Book Store acceptance of your order brings into existence a legally binding contract between us on these terms. Any term sought to be imposed by you in your order will not form part of the contract.
 Book Store are entitled to withdraw from any contract in the case of obvious errors or inaccuracies regarding the goods appearing on our website. If an error or inaccuracy is discovered with regards to the advertised price of the goods that you have ordered, we will contact you as soon as possible by email. This will be to inform you of the correct price of the goods, and to ask you if you wish to continue with the order at the amended price, or to cancel the order altogether.</p>
  
 
 <h3 className="terms-paragraph-header">Withdrawal By You From the Contract</h3>
 <p>If you are an individual and are not buying goods on behalf of a business, there are certain circumstances in which you may withdraw from the contract and these are set out here. This right to withdraw does not apply to business buyers.</p>
 
 <p>You may withdraw your order for goods at any time up to the end of the twenty first working day after you have received the goods. You do not need to give Book Store any reason for withdrawing your order nor will you have to pay any penalty.</p>
 <p>The only circumstance in which you cannot withdraw your order is where you have taken the goods you have ordered (or the ones in relation to which you want to withdraw) out of the sealed package in which they were delivered.</p>
 <p>To withdraw your order you must notify Book Store in writing at the address set out in the Book Store returns section of Book Store.com.</p>
 <p>If you have received the goods before you withdraw your order then, unless you have lost your right to withdraw because you have taken the goods out of their sealed package, you must send them back to the Book Store return address at your own cost and risk, (or a local Book Store store) unless the goods were supplied faulty or damaged. If you withdraw your order but Book Store has already processed the goods for delivery and you have received them, you must not unpack the goods when they are received by you and you must send the goods back to Book Store at the Book Store return address at your own cost and risk as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>Once you have notified Book Store that you are withdrawing your order, any sum debited to Book Store from your credit card will be re-credited to your account as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of your order.</p>
  
 
 <h3 className="terms-paragraph-header">Availability of Goods You Order</h3>
 <p>In some circumstances, we may place a limit on the number of copies of a particular book or product, or series of books or products, that you can order. This may, for example, be where we have limited stocks of a particular book or product, whether caused by limitations placed on us by our suppliers, where a book is signed by an author or otherwise. Where we are aware of this, we will notify you prior to an order being made. Whether or not we have notified you before you have placed an order, if Book Store has insufficient stock to deliver some or all of the goods ordered by you, or where you have ordered or sought to order (whether in one transaction or multiple transactions, and whether from one or more customer accounts) goods in excess of any quantity limits we have imposed, we will notify you as soon as possible of which parts of your order we will accept and which we will reject. Sums debited (if any) by Book Store from your debit or credit card, or from any other source of payment in respect of goods we are unable or unwilling to supply to you will be re-credited to your account and Book Store will notify you by email at the address given by you in your order form of which orders have been satisfied and which have been rejected. Any refund will be made as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of your order. Book Store will not be obliged to offer any additional compensation for disappointment suffered.</p>
 
 <p>Please also note: in furtherance of the above provisions, we endeavour to bring our customers the best value we can by running special offers, but please remember stocks are limited at the special offer price, and subject to availability. We update our website as quickly as we can to minimise disappointment. The process of updating the website when goods have sold out at promotional price can take a few hours to update. Please note that the price the goods are offered for tender are as displayed in the Shopping Basket. Rest assured your debit or credit card will only be debited as your order or individual items from your order are dispatched.</p>
 
  
 
 <h3 className="terms-paragraph-header">Multi-buy Offers</h3>
 <p>Prices exclude postage and packing. Promotions apply to listed titles only, which are subject to change and availability. If you choose to purchase a product from a multi-buy offer, but do not purchase enough products to qualify for the special discount, the product will be charged at the normal price. Please note that on 3 for 2 promotions (and other multi-buy offers), the lowest priced title will always be the 'free' item.</p>
